// If the index is not known, which is the case most of the time, then we can check every element in the Array. We continue checking elements until we find the element we're looking for, or we reach the end of the Array. This technique for finding an element by checking through all elements one by one is known as the linear search algorithm. In the worst case, a linear search ends up checking the entire Array. Therefore, the time complexity for a linear search is O(N)O(N).
