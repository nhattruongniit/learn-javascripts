    <script type="text/javascript">
        /*
          Given two strings a and b, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string a so 
          that string b is a substring of it. If it is impossible for b​​​​​​ to be a substring of a after repeating it, return -1.
          Notice: string "abc" repeated 0 times is "", repeated 1 time is "abc" and repeated 2 times is "abcabc".
          Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
          Output: 3

          Input: a = "a", b = "aa"
          Output: 2
