    <div style="width: 50%">
      Let's start with the concept of an instance. To make it simple, an
      instance is like a unique copy of a blueprint. Imagine you have a
      blueprint for a house. The blueprint itself is not a house, but using it,
      you can build as many houses as you want. Each house you build using the
      blueprint is an instance of that blueprint.
      <br />
      <br />
      In JavaScript, when we talk about instances, we are often referring to
      objects that have been created from a constructor function. The
      constructor function serves as the blueprint, and each object created from
      it is an instance.
      <br />
      <br />
      To create an instance, or to build a 'house' using our 'blueprint', we use
      the <b>new</b> keyword
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      function Car(make, model, year) {
        this.make = make;
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;

        this.getAge = function () {
          const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
          return currentYear - this.year;
        };
      }

      const myCar = new Car("Honda", "Civic", 2020);
      const yourCa = new Car("Kia", "K3", 2010);

      console.log("myCar year", myCar.getAge());
    </script>
